	# The Mapi::PropertySet class is used to wrap the lower level Msg or Pst property stores,
	# and provide a consistent and more friendly interface. It allows you to just say:
	#
	#   properties.subject

	# instead of:
	#
	#   properites.raw[0x0037, PS_MAPI]
	#

	# compromise is to cache all the available keys, and just return the values on demand, rather
	# than load up many possibly unwanted values.
