	#
	# = Introduction
	#
	# Primary class interface to the vagaries of .msg files.
	#
	# The core of the work is done by the <tt>Msg::PropertyStore</tt> class.
	#
	class Msg < Message
		#
		# = Introduction
		#
		# A big compononent of +Msg+ files is the property store, which holds
		# all the key/value pairs of properties. The message itself, and all
		# its <tt>Attachment</tt>s and <tt>Recipient</tt>s have an instance of
		# this class.
		#
		# = Storage model
		#
		# Property keys (tags?) can be either simple hex numbers, in the
		# range 0x0000 - 0xffff, or they can be named properties. In fact,
		# properties in the range 0x0000 to 0x7fff are supposed to be the non-
		# named properties, and can be considered to be in the +PS_MAPI+
		# namespace. (correct?)
		# 
		# Named properties are serialized in the 0x8000 to 0xffff range,
		# and are referenced as a guid and long/string pair.
		#
		# There are key ranges, which can be used to imply things generally
		# about keys.
		#
		# Further, we can give symbolic names to most keys, coming from
		# constants in various places. Eg:
		# 
		#   0x0037 => subject
		#   {00062002-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}/0x8218 => response_status
		#   # displayed as categories in outlook
		#   {00020329-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}/"Keywords" => categories
		# 
		# Futher, there are completely different names, coming from other
		# object models that get mapped to these things (CDO's model,
		# Outlook's model etc). Eg "urn:schemas:httpmail:subject"
		# I think these can be ignored though, as they aren't defined clearly
		# in terms of mapi properties, and i'm really just trying to make
		# a mapi property store. (It should also be relatively easy to
		# support them later.)
		# 
		# = Usage
		#
		# The api is driven by a desire to have the simple stuff "just work", ie
		#
		#   properties.subject
		#   properties.display_name
		# 
		# There also needs to be a way to look up properties more specifically:
		# 
		#   properties[0x0037] # => gets the subject
		#   properties[0x0037, PS_MAPI] # => still gets the subject
		#   properties['Keywords', PS_PUBLIC_STRINGS] # => gets outlook's categories array
		# 
		# The abbreviated versions work by "resolving" the symbols to full keys:
		#
		#		# the guid here is just PS_PUBLIC_STRINGS
		#   properties.resolve :keywords # => #<Key {00020329-0000-0000-c000-000000000046}/"Keywords">
		#   # the result here is actually also a key
		#   k = properties.resolve :subject  # => 0x0037
		#   # it has a guid
		#   k.guid == Msg::Properties::PS_MAPI # => true
		#
		# = Parsing
		#
		# There are three objects that need to be parsed to load a +Msg+ property store:
		# 
		# 1. The +nameid+ directory (<tt>Properties.parse_nameid</tt>)
		# 2. The many +substg+ objects, whose names should match <tt>Properties::SUBSTG_RX</tt>
		#    (<tt>Properties#parse_substg</tt>)
		# 3. The +properties+ file (<tt>Properties#parse_properties</tt>)
		#
		# Understanding of the formats is by no means perfect.
		#
		# = TODO
		#
		# * While the key objects are sufficient, the value objects are just plain
		#   ruby types. It currently isn't possible to write to the values, or to know
		#   which encoding the value had.
		# * Update this doc.
		# * Perhaps change from eager loading, to be load-on-demand.
